It is web application that allows users to ask questions about Python and get answers from a large language model (LLM). The LLM is trained on a massive dataset of text and code, and it can generate text, translate languages, write different kinds of creative content, and answer your questions in an informative way.

It built using langchain , streamlit and OpenAi module. you can use other api key other then OpenAi like Google AI Language Model or the Megatron-Turing NLG. for that you have to make changes in code .
